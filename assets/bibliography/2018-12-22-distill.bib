  abstract = {The autonomous car must recognize the driving environment quickly for safe driving. As the Light Detection And Range (LiDAR) sensor is widely used in the autonomous car, fast semantic segmentation of LiDAR point cloud, which is the point-wise classification of the point cloud within the sensor framerate, has attracted attention in recognition of the driving environment. Although the voxel and fusion-based semantic segmentation models are the state-of-the-art model in point cloud semantic segmentation recently, their real-time performance suffer from high computational load due to high voxel resolution. In this paper, we propose the fast voxel-based semantic segmentation model using Point Convolution and 3D Sparse Convolution (PCSCNet). The proposed model is designed to outperform at both high and low voxel resolution using point convolution-based feature extraction. Moreover, the proposed model accelerates the feature propagation using 3D sparse convolution after the feature extraction. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art real-time models in semantic segmentation of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, and achieves the real-time performance in LiDAR point cloud inference.}

ABSTRACT = {LiDAR-based Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), which provides environmental information for autonomous vehicles by map building, is a major challenge for autonomous driving. In addition, the semantic information has been used for the LiDAR-based SLAM with the advent of deep neural network-based semantic segmentation algorithms. The semantic segmented point clouds provide a much greater range of functionality for autonomous vehicles than geometry alone, which can play an important role in the mapping step. However, due to the uncertainty of the semantic segmentation algorithms, the semantic segmented point clouds have limitations in being directly used for SLAM. In order to solve the limitations, this paper proposes a semantic segmentation-based LiDAR SLAM system considering the uncertainty of the semantic segmentation algorithms. The uncertainty is explicitly modeled by proposed probability models which are come from the data-driven approaches. Based on the probability models, this paper proposes semantic registration which calculates the transformation relationship of consecutive point clouds using semantic information with proposed probability models. Furthermore, the proposed probability models are used to determine the semantic class of the points when the multiple scans indicate different classes due to the uncertainty. The proposed framework is verified and evaluated by the KITTI dataset and outdoor environments. The experiment results show that the proposed semantic mapping framework reduces the errors of the mapping poses and eliminates the ambiguity of the semantic information of the generated semantic map.},
